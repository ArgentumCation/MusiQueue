# About Our App

### App Description

The users of the application are guests in a space where Youtube music is played, in addition to hosts who play Youtube for their guests.


​        
​          Users will use the application to queue music and vote on changes to the current queue. That is, users have the ability to see the entire music queue. They may search up music and add it to the queue. Any songs in queue deemed too unpopular may be voted on to be removed from queue, or simply removed by the host. Queuing can be rate limited.


​       
​          This app will help solve the problem by abstracting and automating the process of queuing songs. This web app leverages the ubiquity of internet-connected devices to reduce the work on the host's part. Such abstraction has the added benefit of anonymizing the guests' preferences.
​
