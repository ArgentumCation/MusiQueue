        <h1>Topic Proposal</h1>
        <h2>by Daniel Lin</h2>

            <h3>Problem Description</h3>
            <p>
                Parties and other events often play music.
                An issue is that listeners rarely have control over what type of music is played;
                they have little participation in the listening experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, at a party, a host may be playing a <a
                    href="https://support.spotify.com/us/using_spotify/playlists/create-a-playlist/"
                    target="_blank">playlist</a> of tracks,
                but their guests want to queue songs that are not on the playlist.
                In this case, the host would need to manually <a
                    href="https://support.spotify.com/us/using_spotify/features/play-queue/" target="_blank">queue</a>
                music on their phone.
                The broader issue is that there is no way for a host to gauge the overall sentiment of their
                listeners.
                Listeners may want to skip the current song, change the genre, or pick a song with faster beats
                per minute.
                Also, there is no way to measure the consensus of the listeners.
                Does the entire party hate the music that the host is playing?
                Or is it simply one elitist listener who really wants to skip songs?
            </p>
            <p>
                The information problem is that there is much ambiguity between what music hosts think their
                guests will enjoy,
                and what music guests truly enjoy. Querying guests directly is often slow, inaccurate, and
                awkward.
                There are currently no digital solutions which allow hosts to tailor their music according to a
                holistic
                assessment of guestsâ€™ music attitudes.
            </p>

            <h3>App Description</h3>
            <p>
                The users of the application are guests in a space where Spotify music is played, in addition to
                hosts who play
                Spotify for their guests.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users will use the application to queue music and vote on changes to the current queue. That is,
                users have
                the ability to see the entire music queue. They may search up music and add it to the queue. Any
                songs in queue deemed
                too unpopular may be voted on to be removed from queue, or simply removed by the host. Queuing
                can be rate limited.
            </p>
            <p>
                This app will help solve the problem by abstracting and automating the process of queuing songs.
                This web app
                leverages the ubiquity of internet-connected devices to reduce the work on the host's part. Such
                abstraction has
                the added benefit of anonymizing the guests' preferences.
            </p>
