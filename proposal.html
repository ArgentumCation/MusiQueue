            <p>
                A common problem that many people face at small gatherings is curating background music. Most speakers only allow one device to play music at once, which results in either A) a single person controlling the playlist, or B) one person passing their
                phone around so people can pick which song plays, followed by a period of awkward silence between songs. Both of these situations are suboptimal since they prevent the democratization of the party's music and require regular intervention from users.

            <p>
                One existing attempt to solve this issue is the Chromecast. Chromecasts offer this functionality, but require a Chromecast-capable device to play music. Devices must also support the chromecast protocol in order to actually use the service. Google's
                information on Chromecast queuing abilities can be located

            <h1>App Description</h1>
            <p>The intended userbase for this application is groups of people at a small gathering, like a party, or a club meeting. Groups of users will be able to use the app to create and modify a music/video queue, and then be able to have a device play the
                music/videos in that playlist as other users in the group add/remove songs from the queue.
