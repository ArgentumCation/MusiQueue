            <h1>Problem Description</h1>
            <p>
                A common problem that many people face at small gatherings is curating background music. Most speakers only allow one device to play music at once, which results in either A) a single person controlling the playlist, or B) one person passing their
                phone around so people can pick which song plays, followed by a period of awkward silence between songs. Both of these situations are suboptimal since they prevent the democratization of the party's music and require regular intervention from users.
            </p>

            <p>
                One existing attempt to solve this issue is the Chromecast. Chromecasts offer this functionality, but require a Chromecast-capable device to play music. Devices must also support the chromecast protocol in order to actually use the service. Google's
                information on Chromecast queuing abilities can be located
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/ios_sender/queueing">here
                </a>. 
                Spotify is also working on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/31/spotify-social-listening/">a solution</a> to this issue, however it is limited to spotify users and spotify's (arguably limited) music library.

            <h1>App Description</h1>
            <p>The intended userbase for this application is groups of people at a small gathering, like a party, or a club meeting. Groups of users will be able to use the app to create and modify a music/video queue, and then be able to have a device play the music/videos in that playlist as other users in the group add/remove songs from the queue.</p> <p> This helps solve the issue mentioned above, by giving uses the ability to work together to choose what music plays. This would also be useful in situations like car rides in which interacting with and passing a device around would prove difficult. A web app would also enable pulling music from mutiple sources, like Spotify, Youtube, and BandCamp, which would maximise the amount of available music.

            <h2>App Functionality</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>User A Creates a 'Room' and becomes a 'Party Leader' </li>
                <li>Users B, C, D et al. join the Room as 'Guests' </li>
                <li>Any user in room adds songs to queue</li>
                <li>Any user in room hits play button, and audio plays from User A's device</li>
